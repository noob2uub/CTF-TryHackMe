## Table of Contents

*Possibly include a table of contents here, though this is only necessary for larger writeups ...*

- [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
- [recon](#recon)
- [exploiting](#exploiting)
- [etc.](#etc)

## recon

*Try to make the writeup neatly structured, so it's easy to follow along.*

## exploiting

*Descriptive subheadings make for a more structured writeup as well.*

## etc.

*Etc. this is just a template, you'll know what to do... ^^ Change it, if you feel like it, use it like this if you don't ...*
