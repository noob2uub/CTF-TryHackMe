Host = 10.10.150.7581.3

Enumeration / Scanning
Let's start with an initial Nmap scan.

Service / Port Enumeration

# NMAP

```console

Going through this page there are a few images with joker quotes, they may come in handy, but lets keep looking for the first secret.

There is allot to read in this section, so let start from the top and work our way down. Nothing but a good story, so lets run go buster. I like to start with a common or small wordlist then run a larger one to follow up, just so i can start searching things and then find out if i missed anything.

nothing to exciting here so I dedcided to run a 2.3-small.txt and another common.txt scan but for php,html, and txt

```console

### We find secret.txt that should be something interesting. 

```console
Batman hits Joker.

Joker: "Bats you may be a rock but you won't break me." (Laughs!)

Batman: "I will break you with this rock. You made a mistake now."

Joker: "This is one of your 100 poor jokes, when will you get a sense of humor bats! You are dumb as a rock."

Joker: "HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!"
```
Nothing to interestesting just an exchange between the two, lets run a .txt search with another word list. Maybe rockyou since he talks about hitting him with a rock?

Ok, that was a waste of time the flag was a bit more obvious then I thought it would be.  

### Browsing to port 8080

We see we have a weblogin available, so lets gather a bit more information on this page.
