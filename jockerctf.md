Host = 10.10.150.7581.3

Enumeration / Scanning
Let's start with an initial Nmap scan.

Service / Port Enumeration

# NMAP

```console
nmap -sC -sV -A -T4 -Pn 10.10.150.75

We see that ports 22, 80, and 8080 are open

### Browsing to 10.10.150.75

Going through this page there are a few images with joker quotes, they may come in handy, but lets keep looking for the first secret.

There is allot to read in this section, so let start from the top and work our way down. Nothing but a good story, so lets run go buster. I like to start with a common or small wordlist then run a larger one to follow up, just so i can start searching things and then find out if i missed anything.

### We find secret.txt that should be something interesting. 

```console
Batman hits Joker.

Joker: "Bats you may be a rock but you won't break me." (Laughs!)

Batman: "I will break you with this rock. You made a mistake now."

Joker: "This is one of your 100 poor jokes, when will you get a sense of humor bats! You are dumb as a rock."

Joker: "HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!"
```
Nothing to interestesting just an exchange between the two, lets run a .txt search with another word list. Maybe rockyou since he talks about hitting him with a rock?

Ok, that was a waste of time the flag was a bit more obvious then I thought it would be.  

### Browsing to port 8080

We see we have a weblogin available, so lets gather a bit more information on this page. 

![Screenshot_2022-03-28_10-12-29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68706090/160451447-84d63393-782c-438c-bcb9-9bc8beb964b2.png)

Below shows we just have to do basic authentication with hydra using http-get

Navigating to the site we notice that there isn't much listed here other then its a CMS Blog on Joomla. The default Adminitrative page for joomla is /administrator and that takes us to a new log in. Other ways you can find the admin page is from running a nikto scan or looking at the robots.txt page.

# Robots.txt
```console
# If the Joomla site is installed within a folder 
# eg www.example.com/joomla/ then the robots.txt file 
# MUST be moved to the site root 
# eg www.example.com/robots.txt
# AND the joomla folder name MUST be prefixed to all of the
# paths. 
# eg the Disallow rule for the /administrator/ folder MUST 
# be changed to read 
# Disallow: /joomla/administrator/
#
# For more information about the robots.txt standard, see:
# http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html
#
# For syntax checking, see:
# http://tool.motoricerca.info/robots-checker.phtml

However, it is good that I ran the nikto scan just to highlight how to find the additional page because the Joker's credentials did not work for the admin login. 

![Screenshot_2022-03-28_10-46-37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68706090/160459500-7fba67a7-7942-49aa-97c8-7a3a0ac9978d.png)

I did notice that there is a backup.zip file from the nikto scan, so its a good thing that I did not stop it to early. Also its a good thing that the Joker resuses passes works. You could also brute force it with john if you wanted to. 

![Screenshot_2022-03-28_10-49-42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68706090/160459669-ab7527f2-7333-4e43-8e29-6c727ca9e6ae.png)

I see the file is a backup SQL SB file, so I open it in sublime text and earch for and type of admin credentials. 

```console
LOCK TABLES `cc1gr_users` WRITE;
/*!40000 ALTER TABLE `cc1gr_users` DISABLE KEYS */;
INSERT INTO `cc1gr_users` VALUES (547,'Super Duper User','admin','admin@example.com','$2y$10$b43UqoH5UpXokj2y9e/8U.LD8T3jEQCuxG2oHzALoJaj9M5unOcbG',0,1,'2019-10-08 12:00:15','2019-10-25 15:20:02','0','{\"admin_style\":\"\",\"admin_language\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"editor\":\"\",\"helpsite\":\"\",\"timezone\":\"\"}','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'','',0);
/*!40000 ALTER TABLE `cc1gr_users` ENABLE KEYS */;
UNLOCK TABLES;
```

We have a hash that now we have to start cracking 

Hash = `$2y$10$b43UqoH5UpXokj2y9e/8U.LD8T3jEQCuxG2oHzALoJaj9M5unOcbG'

now lets use john to get through it

### John

```console

```

We now have the password and can log into the admin page of the site, lets look for a reverse shell. 

I found this page, let see what I can do with it

https://www.hackingarticles.in/joomla-reverse-shell/

Start Netcat listener and then edit the template with the reverse shell provided by pentest monkey. Then select preview to launch the reverse shell
